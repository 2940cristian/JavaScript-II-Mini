# JavaScript II Mini
## Topics we will cover
* Recursion
* the 'this' keyword
* constructor functions
* classes


### Instructions
* This repository is provided as more of a follow along structure. 

* In class we will be going over the principles listed above and you will be expected to follow along when the instructor asks you to do so.

### Recursion
* recursion is another way to represent a looping program. 
* Simliar to a `for loop` or a `while loop` a recursive function will loop until you tell it to stop. 
* when solving complex algorithms recursion comes in handy. It is not that great for smaller, less complex algorithms.
 * For every recursive function, you'll need to establish what is called a `base case`. A `base case` is a condition that when triggered, will discontinue the call to your function.
